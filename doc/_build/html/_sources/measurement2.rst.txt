Measurement Class 2.0
=====================

Due to some design flaws in the existsing :class:`measurement.Measurement` class, it will be rewritten from ground up using already existsing libraries. This undertaking will lead to a cleaner version and will make it possible to adapt :class:`measurement.Measurement` more easily for the interferometer experiments.
