How to install PIGOR
====================


Installing PIGOR
----------------

Assuming you have a running installation of Python 3.7 or higher, to install PIGOR please follow these steps:

1. Download the source from Bitbucket, this should include the following files:
    - :code:`measurement.py`
    - :code:`pigor.py`
    - :code:`README.md`
    - :code:`requirements-measurement.py`
    - :code:`requirements-pigor.py`
    - :code:`requirements-dev.py`
2. Install the required python packages with pip: :code:`pip install -r requirements-measurement.txt` (you may need to use pip3 instead of pip depending on your python installation)
3. If you are going to use PIGOR, install the requirements with :code:`pip install -r requirements-pigor.txt`

You can now run PIGOR with the following command in the folder where the :code:`pigor.py` and :code:`measurement.py` files are located::

    python pigor.py


Installing only the Measurement Class
-------------------------------------

In some cases the user may only want to install the measurement module to use the Measurement class as one of their python installations modules. A zip or tarball file should be provided for this use case. See :ref:`deployment-measurement-module`.

To install (and copy into the user's installed modules) simply unpack the zip or tarball. Head over to its directory and type from there:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install


Installation for Developers
---------------------------

A known working set of python modules used to create PIGOR can be found in :code:`requirements-dev.txt`. To install all these requirements, simply type::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
