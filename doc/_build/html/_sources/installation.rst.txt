How to install PIGOR
====================


Installing only the Measurement Class
-------------------------------------

In some cases the user may only want to install the measurement module to use the Measurement class. A zip or tarball file should be provided for this use case. See :ref:`deployment-measurement-module`.

To install (and copy into the user's installed modules) simply unpack the zip or tarball. Head over to its directory and type from there:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install
